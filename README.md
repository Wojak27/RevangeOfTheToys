Revange Of The Toys is an AR game, that takes you to your childhood and lets you protect your own fortress in a "Tower defence" style. This game has been made as a project for a course on Link√∂pings University.
The game is made in a toy world, where you start with gold in the middle of the screen, that you shall protect.
There are two types of enemies: Trains and missilies. To protect against the trains, you should remember to build a tower and, during wave mode, shoot the trains. On random ocasions there is a missile lounching torwards the gold, these missile you can shoot with a minigun that is available when the missile is in the air. 
Below you can see a short preview of the game.

To prevent the toys from taking your gold, you can use alphabet blocks for protection and build towers for more offensive actions.
